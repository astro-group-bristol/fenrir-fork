# Fenrir

This is the codebase for Fenrir used for my thesis work, as supervised by [Chris Reynolds](https://www.astro.umd.edu/~chris/) (U of Maryland, U of Cambridge) and [Cole Miller](https://www.astro.umd.edu/~miller/) (U of Maryland).

This was used in the research presented in Taylor & Reynolds ([2018a](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aaad63),[b](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aae9f2)) and spoken about at numerous conferences.

This is a public archive. I am not maintaining this code.
